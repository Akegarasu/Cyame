Hi, I'm Marlon. A CS Major from China.❤

I love creating, sharing my happiness and love to others.⭐

I like Japanese Culture, and I'm falling with VTuber now😍

I usually use C++, Python as programming language😊

However, most of my repository are about frontends😀

because my beginning year of GitHub is 2020, I'm attracted by Vue then🎈

I love Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains Kits for codes😍

Since I really like the Open Source🤩
